# WHO CODAP Plugin

## Development

### Initial steps

1. Clone this repo and `cd` into it
2. Run `npm install` to pull dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to run `webpack-dev-server` in development mode with hot module replacement

## Testing the plugin in CODAP

Currently there is no trivial way to load a plugin running on a local server with `http` into the online CODAP, which forces `https`. One simple solution is to download the latest `build_[...].zip` file from https://codap.concord.org/releases/zips/, extract it to a folder and run it locally. If CODAP is running on port 8080, and this project is running by default on 3000, you can go to

http://127.0.0.1:8080/static/dg/en/cert/index.html?di=http://localhost:3000

to see the plugin running in CODAP.

Another option is to install `ngrok` (https://ngrok.com/) and run `ngrok http 8080` and use the generated https url in CODAP.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
